## Feedback 
Product
- Problem is well presented and easy to understand. Great to see some research into details such as response times as well as investigation into the current solution.
- Mockups plus architecture diagram give great explanations without needing to read paragraphs of text.
- Users section brings up uncertainties. Is it because people are uncomfortable? What about the wait times mentioned earlier? Is a 34 year old born in 1985 a millenial? Could focus more on the other types of users as well: City of Toronto/311, outreach workers, etc.
- Great to see potential collaboration with 311

Plan
- Roles could have been described in case a non-technical person was reading.
- Conflict scenarios are well fleshed out. 

Overall Quality
