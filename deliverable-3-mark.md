Product
- Achieves MVP status for the problem at hand. Simple but clean and well executed.
  - Appears to be less development in D3 than D2 but perhaps the new features were not highlighted enough in the README or is just a downside of a having a strong D2 product.
- I couldn't drop pins far from Toronto, say in the middle of Lake Erie or a random highway on the way to Barrie.

README.md
- As expected. Explains the problem well and walks the user through the solution.

plan.md
- Being able to QA with minimal effort is a great help in development. Nice to see the work put in to settng that up.

review.md
- The `decision to dedicate 30-45 minutes of every weekly meeting` to... writing tests? QA? 
- Otherwise, as expected.
