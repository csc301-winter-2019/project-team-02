Product
- Great progress. Live updating works well. Map is very functional. App almost achieves MVP in current state so excited to see more in next iteration.

README.md
- Near perfect description. Not too long, but includes enough background info for a new user to understand the problem and what this software is trying to solve.
- Instructions are thorough and easy for a non-technical user to get started on the app.

plan.md
- Awesome to see things like Trello snapshots, etc.
- One of the most extensive and well developed Git workflows I have seen. Nice work. 
- Wiki has lots of useful information for the team. Great to see that put together.
- Goals and Tasks are a bit high level but ok. Artifacts could mention the actual mobile app and web app as well, etc.

review.md
- Reflection on decisions is not only good, they are followed by some unique solutions to the problems. Looks promising for D3.
