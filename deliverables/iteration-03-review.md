# Helpthehome by The Dream Team

## Iteration 3 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Friday March 29th @ 3:00pm
 * Where: BA 3200

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well

 * The decision to swap mobile and web roles was a good decision because it allowed team members to get an understanding of both sides of the application. This resulted in a quicker update meeting because all team members got exposure to all parts of the application. Before switching our updates lasted on average 10-15 minutes, but after switching our updates lasted on average 5-10 minutes.
 * The decision to dedicate 30-45 minutes of every weekly meeting was a good decision because it improved the test coverage on our application and helped identify bugs early on. For example, we were able to identify a bug during our weekly testing in retrieving location services that caused the application to crash and we were able to fix it before merging into the master branch. This saved us the headache of potentially trying to revert merges to see what caused the application to break.
 * The decision to modify our Pull Request process (by Slack reminders and personal DMs), resulted in code getting reviewed quicker and thus we had a lot of cards tested in between meetings, and master was fairly kept up to date. This meant that when new tasks were started, the branches already contained most recent code.
#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

 - Before this iteration, we decided that code reviews should only be done by those more closely involved with that portion of the project. For example, changes to the mobile part of the project were to be reviewed by others with involvement in mobile. Unfortunately, this was not enforced due to occaisonal unresponesiveness of teammembers throughout the iteration.
 - Our decision to swap mobile and web roles was not completely successful. A few teammembers were not able to switch out of their d2 roles due to the increasing complexity of certain parts of the project. In a few cases, there was not enough time for teammembers to become completely familiar with eachothers work.

#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

> Nothing as of this review meeting.

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * All goals for this iteration were completed (see planning doc Goals section) with the exception of no. 4.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * Handling of response from the server when mobile sends out the post request so that the user knows that their report actually went through in a Greeting Page. We did not complete this goal because although we started this task, we could not complete and implement it into our application within the time constraints.


#### Goal not included in this iteration
 * We have a backlog column of a set of goals that we did not have time for in this iteration. For example, adding additional layers to the map which showed different information such as clusters, homeless shelter locations, user profiles etc.

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are focused on preparing for the demo

 * Go over what we are going to say.
 * Make sure everyone understands how the application works and how it is designed.
 * Prepare answers to potential questions that the evaluators might ask.
